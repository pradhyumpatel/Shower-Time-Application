* Roles were not very relavent for this sprint. We all collectively met up to work on one end goal, rather than assign tasks. Ultimately the original idea of having a application that produced how much water was used did not happen due to major set backs from errors and trouble shooting. Thankfully we have a functional page due to Pradhyum figuring it all out day of! You can use the Sprint-03 folder to build your appication.
