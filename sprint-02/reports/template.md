## UI/UX Report

The goal this sprint for UI/UX was to add in a couple users to the database for reference when we began testing the website. We needed one admin user, and one standard user. Also, this sprint we would have update user stories. However there were a plethora of technical difficulties related to Packer and Vagrant scripts that caused a major set back on this end. The issues have now been fixed and should be good for moving forward.

## Developer and Security Assumptions

This sprint the goal was to automate a firewall to protect our applicaiton and database. We would also establish a the least amount of privlages needed per user. For example, admin would have full privilages to the application, a user would have just enough to log in, and track their information, and an anonymous user would only be able to use the timer. However, much like UI/UX we encountered technical difficulties that we had work through over the sprint as a group. Those issues have now been corrected, and should be good for moving forward.
