### UI/UX Design & Jr. Developer
We came into this sprint without an automated database.  We were able to get the database up, but it had to be done manually each time we built.  We were able to finally get the .sql scripts to work properly.  This allowed us to create a prepopulated database during our packer build.  The database consisted of two tables, users and shower times.  It was prepopulated with 2 users and 2 admins.  


### Developer
We started sprint four with partially functional boxes. We had an issue of getting our front end to connect with our backend. While fixing that was in the works, we also started the process of creating css style sheets so when our database connection is successful, we will have pages ready to go.
